## üöÄ Usage

üß≠ **Start the Game**

```
Go to Assets/Scenes/Menu and run the game. Wait for the login screen, then click the 'Play' button to start.
```

üé® **Generate Animation**

Click the **Generate** button, enter your prompt, and wait for the system to apply animations based on your input.

üí° **Tips for Best Experience:**

1. You can select specific characters to apply animations only to them.
2. You can move and rotate the camera around the map for better scene composition.

## üìã Features

- ‚ö° **Real-Time Animation Generation** ‚Äì Seamlessly generate animations within your game using AI.
- üß† **Dynamic NPC Responses** ‚Äì Enhance non-player characters with intelligent and context-aware reactions.
- üé≠ **Adaptive Character Behaviors** ‚Äì Bring your characters to life with dynamic and responsive behavior logic.

üîß **Need AI-powered animation tools?**  
Try our Unity plugin: [Rebellis Character Hub](https://character-hub.rebellis.ai/apihub/unity)

## üìö Code Reference

This section provides insights into key classes and runtime logic within the Rebellis system.

### üì° `RebelisAPIHandler`
Handles all core interactions with the Rebellis AI API, including login, prompt submission, FBX/Unity file generation, and data retrieval.

```csharp
public class RebelisAPIHandler : MonoBehaviour {
    private const string BASE_URL = "https://api.rebellis.ai/api/v1/";
    private const string LOGIN_ENDPOINT = "account/login/";
    private const string PROMPT_ENDPOINT = "transaction/prompts/";
    private const string FBX_ENDPOINT = "transaction/create-fbx/";
    private const string UNITY_ENDPOINT = "transaction/create-unity/";
    // Additional logic to authenticate and fetch content
}
```

> üì° This class is responsible for sending authentication credentials, submitting animation prompts, and downloading the appropriate assets from Rebellis servers.

### üß† `RebellisAnimatorController`
This class listens for Unity asset events from the API handler and dynamically loads and applies downloaded animation clips at runtime.

```csharp
public class RebellisAnimatorController : MonoBehaviour {
    void Start() {
        animator = GetComponent<Animator>();
        _gameManager = FindAnyObjectByType<GameManager>();
        _effect = GetComponent<HighlightEffect>();

        _gameManager.RebelisAPIHandler.OnUnityFileReady.AddListener(OnNewAnimationArrived);
    }

    IEnumerator LoadAssetBundleFromURL(string url) {
        _gameManager.RebelisAPIHandler?.OnProgressStatusChanged?.Invoke(99);
        UnityWebRequest request = UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle(url);
        yield return request.SendWebRequest();

        if (request.result != UnityWebRequest.Result.Success) {
            Debug.LogError($"Failed to load AssetBundle: {request.error}");
            yield break;
        }

        AssetBundle bundle = DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.GetContent(request);
        if (bundle == null) {
            Debug.LogError("Failed to load AssetBundle from the downloaded content.");
            yield break;
        }

        AnimationClip asset = bundle.LoadAsset<AnimationClip>(assetName);
        if (asset != null && Selected) {
            AnimatorOverrideController overrideController = new AnimatorOverrideController(animator.runtimeAnimatorController);
            overrideController["rebel"] = asset;
            animator.runtimeAnimatorController = overrideController;
            _effect.highlighted = false;
            Selected = false;
            _gameManager.PanelController.ForceFill();
        } else {
            Debug.LogError($"Asset '{assetName}' not found in AssetBundle.");
        }

        bundle.Unload(false);
    }
}
```

> üß† This class serves as the runtime bridge between asset delivery and gameplay execution. It listens to UnityEvents like `OnUnityFileReady` and ensures the animation is seamlessly injected into the current scene.

üìÅ **You can find both classes in:**
```
Assets/Rebellis/Script
```
